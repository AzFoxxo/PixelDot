# PixelDot
PixelDot is a simple game framework written in C# utilising SFML.net to provide a fantasy console-esque environment for creating games with imposed limitations and is based around only using individual pixels as the base unit of graphics.

This project is currently in development and is only made as a proof of concept and should be not be used for any important projects. Performance is not a priority and even the line method repeatedly calls the pixel method to draw a line leading to performance issues extremely quickly.
